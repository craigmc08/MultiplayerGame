| Location | TODO
|:------|:------:|:------
| static/js/app.js | Add window resizing logic

| client js | document with comments, create minified code that will be served to players (minimize hacking, maximize future me understanding of client code)
| lib/util.js | make player-player collisions bouncy (A increases velocity of B)
| lib/physicsobject.js:111 | Calculate bullet push force based on displacent from players center (or see if that looks better than how it is being done now)
